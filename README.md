# 📊 Clustering Analysis on PriceRunner Dataset
This project performs clustering analysis on the PriceRunner dataset to gain insights into products and merchants through data segmentation. The goal is to group similar products and identify comparable merchants based on pricing and category information.

# 🔍 Methodology
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
  
# 📁 Dataset Description
- 35,310 records
- 7 features

# 📈 Clustering Evaluation
The clustering quality was evaluated using silhouette scores:
K-Means Clustering: 0.5418
Hierarchical Clustering: 0.5250

K-Means achieved a slightly higher silhouette score, indicating better-defined clusters, although both methods performed similarly on this dataset.


# 🎯 Key Outcomes
Effective product segmentation
Identification of similar merchants
Comparative analysis of clustering techniques
