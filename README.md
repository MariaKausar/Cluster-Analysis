# Cluster-Analysis
The silhouette scores compare the clustering quality of K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering. K-Means achieved a silhouette score of 0.5418, slightly higher than Hierarchical Clustering's score of 0.5250. This indicates that K-Means provides marginally better-defined clusters, though both methods perform similarly on this dataset.
